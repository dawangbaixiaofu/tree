**core algorithms and data structure**
- quick sort
    sort samples along feature values
- shuffle
    random to draw a feature from the candidated features to sort 
- dfs and bfs
    build a tree using deep first algorithm
- linked list + array = tree data structure
    using ‘array[node]’ data structure to represents a tree.
