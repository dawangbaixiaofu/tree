**core algorithms and data structure**
- quick sort \
    sort samples along feature values
- shuffle \
    random to draw a feature from the candidated features to sort 
- dfs and bfs \
    build a tree using deep first algorithm
- linked list + array = tree data structure \
    using ‘array[node]’ data structure to represents a tree.
- row and column index array \
    row[start:end] represents samples to select, and after sort only swap row[index_bigger] and row[index_litter]
  that is we only swap row[index] value and do not change index value, then we can pay attention only to index in range [start:end].
